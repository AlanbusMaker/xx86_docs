# I want to buy the CRX986-1400 for my PC. Are there any links to buy it?
Answer: Actually, NO. 😁🔥
To begin with, it's a lobbying project, because it's for fun :D (I can't imagine servers using xx86)
And according to CRX986-1400, it's fictitious hardware. But you can still buy it!
BUT HOW, DAMN IT? (Buy here:D)[https://ppp.pbay] (Adjust https:// to pb://, then it'll work 😎🔥)
